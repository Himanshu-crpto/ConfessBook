<h1>Confessions Web-App</h1>
This Web-App actually helps you to confess your secrets.<br>

The user has to signup, either manually or using Google.<br>
The user's credentials are authenticated and encrypted.<br>

Then he/she can confess secrets anonymously.<br>
The user can also view other's confessions, without actually knowing who confessed them.<br>

The user can logout and login whenever he/she wants later on, either manually or with Google.<br>
The user's sessions are saved unless he/she logs out and doesn't need to sign in everytime the website is opened.
